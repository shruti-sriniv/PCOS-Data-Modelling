# PCOS-Data-Modelling

# PCOS, or Poly-Cystic Ovarian Syndrome is a condition estimated to affect 1 in 3 women.

# As of today, there is no cure for PCOS, but implementing various lifestyle changes, such as exercising more, eating healthy, and avoiding processed sugars and dairy can greatly lessen symptoms. 

# The purpose of this project is to build a model to predict the likelihood of a woman having PCOS, given the symptoms of PCOS that she experiences, hair folicle count, age, weight, and various other factors. The aim here is to help more women discover the likelihood of them having this condition so they can proactively implement lifestyle changes to counteract the symptoms they may be experiencing now or could experience in the future.
